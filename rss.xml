            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Colorado's Woody Creek Distillers</h1><p>Only last week a panel of expert judges convened for the annual San Francisco World Spirits Competition-arguably the most prestigious and analytical booze assembling in the States. While the complete results won't be formally announced until 4 April, it's already known that Colorado's independently owned Woody Creek Distillers (located just a 20-minute drive from downtown Aspen) won double gold for one of their newer releases: a tasty small-batch Colorado Straight Rye.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b64dca9b02fd08fb329890c39fa2430abff82993.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Despite their exotic designs, Brodeur relies on common colors of familiar fruits to create this Willy Wonka-esque habitat where you can't help but want to reach out and gobble everything up.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4d6c337dd3c98bcadd87c6b27fd94f1493ae65eb.jpg"></article>]]></description>
